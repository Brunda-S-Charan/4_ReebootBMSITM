# Project Title: KrishiConnect: A Digital Platform for Direct Farmer-Buyer Engagement
KrishiConnect is a web based app designed to eliminate the middle layer in the agricultural supply chain. It enables farmers to list their crops and produce along with relevant details such as quantity, quality, expected price, and harvest date. On the other end, buyers can search for produce by category, location, or pricing, and directly initiate contact or place orders.
