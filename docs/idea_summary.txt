Project Title:
KrishiConnect: A Digital Platform for Direct Farmer-Buyer Engagement

Brief Description of the Project
Agriculture remains the backbone of the Indian economy, yet farmers often struggle to get fair prices for their produce due to the involvement of multiple intermediaries. These middlemen not only reduce farmers’ profit margins but also delay the selling process, leading to spoilage and wastage of perishable goods. There is a critical need for a transparent, reliable, and easy-to-use digital solution that connects farmers directly with end-buyers—consumers, wholesalers, retailers, or institutions.
KrishiConnect is a web based app designed to eliminate the middle layer in the agricultural supply chain. It enables farmers to list their crops and produce along with relevant details such as quantity, quality, expected price, and harvest date. On the other end, buyers can search for produce by category, location, or pricing, and directly initiate contact or place orders.

The platform includes the following core features:
•	Produce Listing: Farmers can upload details of available produce, including images, grade, and harvest timelines.
•	Location-Based Search: Buyers can discover nearby produce, optimizing logistics and freshness.
•	In-App Chat & Negotiation: A built-in communication tool enables seamless discussions on price, quality, and delivery.
•	Smart Notifications: Farmers receive alerts when buyers show interest, request quotes, or confirm purchases.
•	Order Tracking & History: Both parties can manage past transactions and build trust through rating systems.
•	Market Insights (Optional Phase 2): Price trends, best-selling produce, demand hotspots.

Technology Stack (Planned MVP)
•	Frontend: React (web based)
•	Backend: Firebase / Node.js
•	Database: Firestore (real-time DB for fast sync)
•	Additional APIs: Google Maps (for geo-tagging), SMS Gateway (for notifications)

Initial Evaluation & Viability
The project has been scoped to build a functioning prototype within 48 hours, focusing on:
•	Produce listing UI
•	Buyer-side search and view
•	Basic in-app messaging
•	Firebase backend connectivity
•	Mock buyer-farmer interaction flow
This MVP will demonstrate the core concept and potential for impact, even without full production-scale features like payment integration or delivery logistics.

Potential Impact
•	Increase in farmer income through direct sales
• Empowerment and digitization of rural farmers
•	Reduction in dependency on middlemen and commission agents
•	Fresh produce access for buyers and local vendors
